What is your idea about **Data Communication**
	- transporting data from one point to another
	- exchange of data between two devices via transmission medium

**Basic Components** to perform Data Communication
	- the information to be communicated (**MESSAGE / DATA**)
		- includes text, numbers, pictures, audio and video, or their combination
	- Transmitter (**SENDER**)
		- device that sends the message
		- can be a computer or the likes.
	-  the device that receives the message (**RECEIVER**)
		- can be computer, workstation, telephone and the likes
	- Transmission Medium
		- the physical path by which the message travels.
		- examples are TP Cables, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, laser or radio waves
	- **PROTOCOL**
		- a set of rules that govern data communications
		- it represents an agreement between the communicating devices
		- Example protocols![[Pasted image 20230822111538.png]]
		- HTTP Protocol ![[Pasted image 20230822111621.png]]

**Effective Data Communication**
	Characteristics of Effective Data Communication
		1. Delivery
			- the system must deliver data to the *correct destination*
		2. Accuracy
			- the system must deliver the data *accurately*
		3. Timeliness
			- the system must deliver data in a *timely manner*
		4. Jitter
			- refers to the *variation* in the packet arrival time

**Data Flow and Data Traffic**
	**1. Simplex**
		- One way communication
		- Example: keyboard can only introduce input; monitor can only accept output
	**2. Half Duplex**
		- Each station can both transmit and receive but not simultaneously
		- Example: hubs are half duplex
	**3. Full Duplex**
		- also called duplex
		- both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously
